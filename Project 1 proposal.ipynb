Most of these are with numerical values. The difficult parts will be modeling data, and what we will use to represent them. Initially the group will go through the data with the focus on their research question, then will proceed with displaying that information through tableau/collab notebook plotting. Each member will start with their initial responsibilities listed above then they will share the information and continue to see how it overall will link together and form a story to present at the end. Each member is given these responsibilities to process the data individually while focusing on a part of the project and sharing that information to the rest of the group then collaborate to create a end goal presentation. To make this project a success, after the individual work, collaborating and making a sensible story to present. Overall, the retail sales dataset isn't complex in understanding so our main focus is making sure that the different parts relate to each other and doesn't go 'off the rails' and makes sense working together and for what is going to be presented."],"metadata":{"id":"3wNRN0gIrkKA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Approved by Dr. Savala on: XX/XX/XXXX"],"metadata":{"id":"vVcSFuoXmmiy"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Yk7cqReAl3_q"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
