# Retail-Sales
Project 1 for Math3439 over retail sales

Utilizing the retails sales csv files, we analyze what factors impacts retail sales such as unemployment, fuel prices, and holidays. Then with an understanding of those variables to sales, we intended to compare the combination of those factors that would lead to the best sales weeks as well as the worst ones. However, the project only got to the comparison stage of specific research question with a slight exploration into the combination.
